# Tsyganenko Data Assimilation

## Instructions

Open the Makefile and set the name of the model to use and the inputfile to be read by the Tsyganenko models. 
Possible models to choose are
* T89
* T96
* TS04
* TA15
The `INPUT` name should be the name of a file in `model/input`, without `.csv`. For example, if an inputfile named `input_Vx.csv` exists, the value for `INPUT` would be `input_Vx`. The ensemble will be saved in the `output` folder of the respective model. The ensemble is created by simply running
```
make ensemble
```
The domain of influence can then be generated by calling
```
make representer
```

## TODO

- [x] Changed Fortran code to read a specific input file.
- [x] Use python to generate this csv input file
- [x] Give this file to fortran code, which generates a result for each line
- [x] Read results via python and use them to perform data assimilation
- [x] Automate process using Makefile
- [ ] Automatic generation of expected folders
